    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Twitter has now become a useful way to build one's business as it helps in giving the brand a voice and a personality. The platform is also a quick, easy and inexpensive way to gain valuable insight from the desired audience. Identifying the sentiments about the product/brand can help the business take better actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "This dataset contains around 7k tweet text with the sentiment label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file train.csv has 3 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "tweet_id - Unique id for tweets. tweet - Tweet about the brand/product sentiment - 0: Negative, 1: Neutral, 2: Positive, 3: Can't Tell\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Metric\n",
    "We will be using ‘weighted’ F1-measure as the evaluation metric for this competition. For more information on the F1-metric refer to https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission format\n",
    "Submission file should have two columns, one for tweet_id and sencond for sentiment [0: Negative, 1: Neutral, 2: Positive, 3: Can't Tell]. A sample submission file has also been attached for reference."
